1.
Package: ascii_art
    - AsciiArtAlgorithm
        Manages the ASCII art generation process. Converts images to ASCII art using a given set of
        characters.
        Uses `Image` and `SubImgCharMatcher` from `image` and `image_char_matching` packages, respectively.
        It also maintains a cache of sub-image brightness values.

    - KeyboardInput
        Handles keyboard input from the user.
        It interacts with other classes for user inputs.

    - Shell
        Provides a command-line interface for the user to interact with the ASCII art generation program.
        Uses `AsciiArtAlgorithm`, `Image`, `AsciiOutput`, and `SubImgCharMatcher`.
        It interacts with the user and manages input commands to manipulate the ASCII art generation process.

Package: ascii_output
    - AsciiOutput
        An interface defining a method to output ASCII art.
        Implemented by `ConsoleAsciiOutput` and `HtmlAsciiOutput`.

    - ConsoleAsciiOutput
        Outputs ASCII art to the console.

    - HtmlAsciiOutput
        Outputs ASCII art to an HTML file.
        Implements `AsciiOutput`.

Package: image
    - BrightnessCalculation
        Calculates the brightness of image sub-images. Uses `Image`.

    - Image
        Represents an image with methods to manipulate and analyze it.
        Used by `BrightnessCalculation`, `AsciiArtAlgorithm`, `Padding`, and `Slicing`.

    - Padding
        Adds padding to images to ensure dimensions fit certain criteria (e.g., powers of two). Uses `Image`.

    - Slicing
        Slices an image into smaller sub-images based on a given resolution. Uses `Image`.

Package: image_char_matching
    - CharConverter
        Converts characters to boolean arrays and buffered images.
        used by `SubImgCharMatcher` for character image processing.

    - SubImgCharMatcher
        Matches sub-images to characters based on brightness. Caches brightness values and performs linear
        stretching on character brightness.
        Used by `AsciiArtAlgorithm` and `Shell`.

2. In the image_char_matching package, in the class SubImgCharMatcher, we used three caches.
   The first cache is a map that stores the raw (before normalization) brightness values of the characters.
   The second cache is a map that stores the
   brightness values of the sub-images. The third cache is a map that stores the brightness values of the sub-images after
   linear stretching. These caches are used to store the brightness values of the characters and sub-images to avoid
   recalculating them every time they are needed. This improves the performance of the algorithm by reducing the number of
   calculations needed to match sub-images to characters.

   We utilized the HashMap data structure in the AsciiArtAlgorithm and SubImgCharMatcher classes.
   In AsciiArtAlgorithm, a HashMap is used for the subImageBrightnessCache to store and quickly retrieve
   brightness values of sub-images, which helps in caching and avoiding redundant calculations.
   In SubImgCharMatcher, HashMap is employed to maintain rawBrightnessMap and normBrightnessMap for storing
   the brightness values of characters.
   The primary advantage of using HashMap is its average-case constant time complexity, O(1), for insertion,
   deletion, and search operations, making it highly efficient for caching and lookup purposes.
   The dynamic resizing feature of HashMap also ensures that it adjusts its capacity as needed, maintaining
   performance efficiency.


3.
- ShellException
    Base class for exceptions related to the Shell.
    Extended by `IncorrectFormatException`, `ResolutionExceedException`, `SmallCharsetException`, and
    `UnknownCommandException`.

- IncorrectFormatException
    Exception for incorrect formats. Inherits from `ShellException`.

- ResolutionExceedException**
    Exception for exceeding resolution limits. Inherits from `ShellException`.

- SmallCharsetException
    Exception for too small character sets. Inherits from `ShellException`.

- UnknownCommandException
    Exception for unknown commands in the shell. Inherits from `ShellException`.

4. The changes we made to the class subImgCharMatcher are the following methods:
getCharSetSize()- This method calculates the size of the character set based on the number of characters in
the set.
printCharSet()- This method prints the character set to the console.

5. We didn't changed the API of the supplied classes.
